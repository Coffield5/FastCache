DriverBooster.exe is an executable file associated with Driver Booster, a software application developed by IObit that is designed to scan and update outdated drivers on Windows systems, thereby improving hardware performance and system stability. While Driver Booster is generally considered safe and is widely used for driver management, users should ensure they download it from the official IObit website or trusted sources to avoid potential malware or counterfeit versions. Some users have reported errors or issues with the program, such as false positives during scans, compatibility problems with certain drivers, or system instability after updates; therefore, it is advisable to create a system restore point before making significant driver changes. Overall, while DriverBooster.exe is not inherently a virus or malware, caution should be exercised to ensure the software is used responsibly and effectively.
